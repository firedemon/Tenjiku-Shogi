Right now, I know of the following bugs
---------------------------------------

- computer does not find book line after loading a file and taking moves back
- toggling the board coords does not work
- strange move L16a-16a when no King left
- RGn jumps over VGn
- need a move-penalty together with move_adj

- (need load-pos save-pos no-rules stuff for checking)
- redo option does not (yet) work

Graphic bugs:
- SEg to high (could be fixed easily)
- FL to large

Please report bugs to edi@esperanto.nu or edi.werner@gmx.de
