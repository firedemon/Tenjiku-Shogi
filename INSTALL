System
------
For the ASCII version, any system with a decent C Compiler should work.
The program was developed under Linux, this is the only platform
*known* to work. You'll also want a fast machine, of course.
(The programming was mainly done on a slow 200 MHz Pentium 1 machine.)
Kanji output is done with unicode, so you'll want an ANSI-capable terminal 
with a unicode font. Otherwise, you'll have to do with the TSA-style 
abbreviations. 


Requirements
-------------

- a C Compiler, preferably GNU C
- perl5.6 at least for building the opening book
  (needed if you want to extend the supplied one, not really necessary yet)
- libreadline and some curses library (ncurses works)

If you want to export nice programs via TeX:
- TeX, metafont, dvipng (the shogi-specific stuff comes with 
  this package and lives in TeX/)

Installation procedure
----------------------

Linux: 
1. Unpack the tenjiku-X.XX.tgz (it unpacks into a directory)
2. cd tenjiku-X.XX
3. Have a look at the top of defs.h and choose the options you like
4. make (have a look at the Makefile first)
(If you get errors like unknown reference to 'tgets' from libreadline, you'll 
have to add -lncurses to the linker flags (your readline library doesn't have 
the curses stuff).


4. Start it and enjoy :-)

Other:
You're on your own, sorry. If you succeed getting it working,
I'd be pleased to submit your informations.
