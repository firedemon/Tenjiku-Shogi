Tenjiku Shogi, by E.Werner (edi.werner@gmx.de)
based on Tom Kerrigan's Simple Chess Program (TSCP).
Right now, this is mainly a tool for analysing, it does not sport a 
reasonable computer opponent. 


Very preliminary documentation for the ASCII Interface:

'help' displays a list of commands (should be self-explanative). 
You can force the computer to move by hitting return.

Look into the INSTALL and TODO files for further information. And the
ultimate documentation, of course, is the source itself ;-)

It has only been tested under linux and you will need:

- a decent C compiler
- an ANSI terminal (preferably unicode-capable)
- readline and ncurses
- TeX and friends if you want to export nice graphics.

And what you get is:
- a Tenjiku board (ASCII, kanji, full kanji)
- lots of rule variants (virtually everything which has been discussed except
for the FEg issue)
- possible moves and influences
- loading and saving games and positions
- an absolutely rotten computer opponent (but at least a very slow one)
- exporting of graphics via TeX

And the best thing: No tedious documentation to dig through and all this comes to you in mint condition - basically untested and with lots of original bugs!
