Very preliminary documentation for the ASCII Interface:

'help' displays a list of commands (should be self-explanative). 
You can force the computer to move by hitting return.


Very preliminary documentation for the GUI:

Mouse commands:
Left mouse moves (click, not drag) around
Left mouse click on destination square moves with promoting, if possible
Right mouse click on destination square moves w.o. promoting

Double moves are done: Left-click - Middle-click - Left/Right-click

Left mouse-click on a square displays possible moves
(green: normal move, red: capture, black: suicide)

Right mouse-click on a square displays influences
(green: normal move, red: capture only, other colors:
 piece can move there after other pieces have moved there)

Note that not all promoted ranks are in red: on a board with
hardware pieces this makes sense because you know immediately
whether to put it face-up or face-down onto the board.
I've used this feature only to distinguish between pieces that
can or cannot promote: so a red ChS is a +VSd while a black ChS
promotes to HT. A FiD or a VGn, however, do not promote so there's
no point in having a red and a black one. A FO or a FBo only exist
after promoting a VM or a SM, so you needn't distinguish here either.
Therefore, these pieces are black.
