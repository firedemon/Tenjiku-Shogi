--------------------- CHANGELOG ----------------------
Latest changes:
2010.01.22
- "setup" will allow to change a position (permeates to savegames)
- positions can be loaded and saved with "lpos" and "spos"
  the files are in positions/ and can be loaded from savegames

2010.01.21
- added "exports" and "savegames" directories so main directory won't be cluttered
- "m(oves)" now shows moves for both side, not only the one whose move it is
- extended "inf", but still very buggy

2010.01.20
- give file to load as startup argument
- show moves to squares with opponent inf as purple, hypothetical moves in blue, suicide moves in red, mark original square black

2010.01.19
fixed the following in TeX export
- osho vs. gyokusho
- upside down pieces
- left and right hand side swapped (was actually up and down swapped)
- spurious line at bottom of page (was page number)
- png conversion with dvipng -D 200 looks nice, has to be autocropped (how?)
 

2010.01.19
- added arrows in "fullkanji" mode for easier identification of pieces
- first hack at TeX export, to fix:
  osho vs. gyokusho (done)
  upside down pieces (done)
  TODO: check promotions (uncomplete!!!!)
  left and right hand side swapped for some reason (done)
  spurious line at bottom of page prevents autocropping (done)
  TODO: display last move with \definecolor{name}{gray}{.8} or
  \definecolor{name}{rgb}{0, 0, .7} and \colorbox{name}{text}
  add dot in four positions (done)
  add directory for screens
  TODO: provide TeX stuff in dist
  add graphic formats to go on converting to (dvipng, dvigif, partly done)

2010.01.18
-fixed display of last move in full kanji mode
2010.01.17
- added: options "fullkanji", "kanji" and "ascii" for kanji or ascii display

2010.01.16
-added: options file to read in at startup (breaks for newline at end of file)
-fixed bug: redo stack wasn't cleared after undo and entering new move
-fixed identifymove: move shortcuts like 6cx or 9d+ are now identified correctly to consider only captures or promotional moves
-fixed havoc resulting in pieces switching color and weird moves being executed with shortcuts
-several small fixes to get rid of the warnings for tenjiku-ansi
-several small bugs newly introduced


2010.01.15
-show last move and move no in "xxx to move" and on the board
-shortcut 'u' for undo added
-fixed 'verytame' FiD
-added piece names to savegame (old-style savegames with "loadold")
-readline support
-added redo
-added go to position after move

---------------------- TODO -------------------------

to fix:
- spurious "Illegal move" on eof
- identifymove doesn't always find the correct move (sometimes leads to pieces changing their color) seems like move still gets onto redo stack, but not on undo
- clear up show_moves (done) and show_influence
- burning doesn't show up in influences - should be several grades
  a) direct move b) move after a pieces type a) has moved c) burning (buggy)
- redo shows wrong piece

to add:
- put savegames into their own folder with extension
- add readline completion for load
- give last move with fully correct attributes (captures, promotion, burns)
- add better documentation (good one!)
- network option
- mating solver
- setup positions
- show checks

consider:
-graphical GUI
-filename completion in load and loadold
-showing and saving trees
-add comments
-show igui among possible moves
- burn_all_FiD not implemented


earlier done:

-make shortcut commands and moves like ZoG (partly ok, giving only one square works, sometimes BUGGY FOR CAPTURING)


minor bugs: influence can't see whether a piece is defended by a jgn and attacked by a jgn
influence need information about attacker and defender values
at least least valuable defender

add random select when equally rated moves

-----------------------------------------------------------

2. Other Ln moves (done)
   Reduce several igui w.o. captures to one (done)
   Ln next to enemy pieces segfaults (fixed)
	

3. Jumping Generals (done)

fix load_game() (done)
area moves!!!, double cat-sword (FEg)
write check one area to prevent 3 nested for-loops
(LHk) (done)

 VGn (done )

4. if Fire Demon moves next to FiD, both disappear (done)
      takeback doesn't restore burnt pieces, but changes
	FiD to opponent's FiD (fixed)

other pieces, promotion (done)

5. Heavenly Tetrarchs (done)

get_steps need get_steps_caps() generating only captures (done)

add piece values  (done)

load_file must understand commands (done)

bug somewhere: changing color of piece (new takeback debug, done?)

bug in Ln move: can leave colored empty square (done?)

attack and in_check need additional code for FiD and CP (done?)

find bug in move generating/retracting (not an overflow!!!)
maybe initialize *everything* we're writing to (done)

add opening book (done)

force move possibility (done)
-------------------------------------------------------------


# add tex stuff to dist (done)
latex tenjikupieces
dvips tenjikupieces
 gs  -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pnm -sOutputFile="|pnmcrop|pnmtotiff > /usr/tmp/tenj%d.tiff" tenjikupieces.ps quit.ps

GRAPHICAL INTERFACE

draw the board (done)

draw_move gets 8k-11k instead of 9l-9k and 9m-9k instead
of 8l-8k (done)
draw_move: drag or click here and there (done)
	make move and animate (done)

undraw_move (done)
graphics (done) for pieces
save and load dialog (done)

help for pieces and coordinates (done)
force button (done)
---------

label Computer is thinking/Your move (done)
display pv (done)
displaying influences during computer thinking kills search (fixed)
move script (done)
book doesn't work for moves from a file (fixed)
implement Ln move, igui doesn't work (fixed)
fix Graphics VSd -> ChS(black) (fixed)

very urgent
----------
fix main-nox11.c (new in_book function)

fix clicking chaos (display time, search depth, which move, cancel move)
fix square sizes for moves/influences

fix panel layout (grid manager in examples/entry.c)

fix Makefile (TeX, X, install target)

better computer player

medium urgent
-------------

rule variants 
board coordinates (doesn't work :-(
smart moves for ascii version

less urgent
----------------------

sound when capturing/making a move
flip view
autoplay button
help dialogs
handicaps
setup


-------------------------------------------------------------
search:

optimise search (4 mio nodes before hang-up in 4-ply!!!!)
quiesce search 

add fractional search depth depending on 
piece value of moving piece / value of all pieces

if pv with +/- 999998 is found, just follow it

there's a bug s.wh. :-)!!!!!!!!!!!

replay option (ask for file, ask for delay between moves)

add square weights for eval()

better opening book (for other variants as well)
with default moves (if not this move reply that)

add init file ~/.tenjiku to read setup



---------------

variants
FiD (TSA), FiD (GH)
LHk (TSA), LHk (CPA)
FEg (TSA), FEg (EW)
JGs (TSA), JGns (EW)
