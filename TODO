---------------------- TODO -------------------------

to fix:
- spurious "Illegal move" on eof
- identifymove doesn't always find the correct move (sometimes leads to pieces changing their color) seems like move still gets onto redo stack, but not on undo
- clear up show_moves (done) and show_influence
- burning doesn't show up in influences - should be several grades
  a) direct move b) move after a pieces type a) has moved c) burning (buggy)
- redo shows wrong piece (loadold qa4, 6c-4e, undo - fixed)


to add:

- put savegames into their own folder with extension (partly done)
- give last move with fully correct attributes (captures, promotion, burns - it's better now)
- add better documentation (good one!)
- setup positions (done)
- show checks (done)
- trim strings for kifu (done)
- keep track of material (done)
- add burning pieces to move_str (done)
- burn information should go into move_bits (done)

- make board turnable
- make colors etc. configurable
- rewrite input parser
- network option
- mating solver
- rewrite input parser
- hide colors from savegames
- trim strings for kifu
- put redos into kifu
- add readline completion for load

consider:
-graphical GUI
-filename completion in load and loadold
-showing and saving trees
-add comments
-show igui among possible moves
- burn_all_FiD not implemented

earlier done:

-make shortcut commands and moves like ZoG (partly ok, giving only one square works, sometimes BUGGY)


minor bugs: influence can't see whether a piece is defended by a jgn and attacked by a jgn
influence need information about attacker and defender values
at least least valuable defender

add random select when equally rated moves

-----------------------------------------------------------

2. Other Ln moves (done)
   Reduce several igui w.o. captures to one (done)
   Ln next to enemy pieces segfaults (fixed)
	

3. Jumping Generals (done)

fix load_game() (done)
area moves!!!, double cat-sword (FEg)
write check one area to prevent 3 nested for-loops
(LHk) (done)

 VGn (done )

4. if Fire Demon moves next to FiD, both disappear (done)
      takeback doesn't restore burnt pieces, but changes
	FiD to opponent's FiD (fixed)

other pieces, promotion (done)

5. Heavenly Tetrarchs (done)

get_steps need get_steps_caps() generating only captures (done)

add piece values  (done)

load_file must understand commands (done)

bug somewhere: changing color of piece (new takeback debug, done?)

bug in Ln move: can leave colored empty square (done?)

attack and in_check need additional code for FiD and CP (done?)

find bug in move generating/retracting (not an overflow!!!)
maybe initialize *everything* we're writing to (done)

add opening book (done)

force move possibility (done)
-------------------------------------------------------------


# add tex stuff to dist (done)
latex tenjikupieces
dvips tenjikupieces
 gs  -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pnm -sOutputFile="|pnmcrop|pnmtotiff > /usr/tmp/tenj%d.tiff" tenjikupieces.ps quit.ps

GRAPHICAL INTERFACE

draw the board (done)

draw_move gets 8k-11k instead of 9l-9k and 9m-9k instead
of 8l-8k (done)
draw_move: drag or click here and there (done)
	make move and animate (done)

undraw_move (done)
graphics (done) for pieces
save and load dialog (done)

help for pieces and coordinates (done)
force button (done)
---------

label Computer is thinking/Your move (done)
display pv (done)
displaying influences during computer thinking kills search (fixed)
move script (done)
book doesn't work for moves from a file (fixed)
implement Ln move, igui doesn't work (fixed)
fix Graphics VSd -> ChS(black) (fixed)

very urgent
----------
fix main-nox11.c (new in_book function)

fix clicking chaos (display time, search depth, which move, cancel move)
fix square sizes for moves/influences

fix panel layout (grid manager in examples/entry.c)

fix Makefile (TeX, X, install target)

better computer player

medium urgent
-------------

rule variants 
board coordinates (doesn't work :-(
smart moves for ascii version

less urgent
----------------------

sound when capturing/making a move
flip view
autoplay button
help dialogs
handicaps
setup


-------------------------------------------------------------
search:

optimise search (4 mio nodes before hang-up in 4-ply!!!!)
quiesce search 

add fractional search depth depending on 
piece value of moving piece / value of all pieces

if pv with +/- 999998 is found, just follow it

there's a bug s.wh. :-)!!!!!!!!!!!

replay option (ask for file, ask for delay between moves)

add square weights for eval()

better opening book (for other variants as well)
with default moves (if not this move reply that)

add init file ~/.tenjiku to read setup
