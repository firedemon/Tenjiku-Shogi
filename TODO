---------------------- TODO -------------------------

to fix:
- after getting one game the program must be restarted as game_id isn't reset
- put player's names to sente and gote in networked game
- aborting game won't work (result must be freed first)
- add resign possibility
- show_moves buggy for fullkanji and rotated board

- allow overwrite on save
- add promoted WBs to the list of FiDs
- spurious "Illegal move" on eof
- clear up show_moves (done) and show_influence
- burning doesn't show up in influences (hopefully done)
  a) direct move b) move after a pieces type a) has moved c) burning (buggy)


to add:
- put whoami and other stuff into configuration file for automatic registration to db
  find a method to say whose move it is (put some of the global variables into db for 
  networked game)

- put savegames into their own folder with extension (partly done, no extension yet)
- add better documentation (good one!)

- make colors etc. configurable
- rewrite input parser
- network option
- mating solver
- rewrite input parser
- hide colors from savegames
- put redos into kifu

consider:
-graphical GUI
-showing and saving trees for a book (into mysql database)
-add comments
-show igui among possible moves

minor bugs:
influence need information about attacker and defender values
at least least valuable defender

add random select when equally rated moves

-----------------------------------------------------------

add opening book (done)

force move possibility (done)
-------------------------------------------------------------


# add tex stuff to dist (done)
latex tenjikupieces
dvips tenjikupieces
 gs  -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pnm -sOutputFile="|pnmcrop|pnmtotiff > /usr/tmp/tenj%d.tiff" tenjikupieces.ps quit.ps


-------------------------------------------------------------
search:

optimise search (4 mio nodes before hang-up in 4-ply!!!!)
quiesce search 

add fractional search depth depending on 
piece value of moving piece / value of all pieces

if pv with +/- 999998 is found, just follow it

there's a bug s.wh. :-)!!!!!!!!!!!

replay option (ask for file, ask for delay between moves)

add square weights for eval()

better opening book (for other variants as well)
with default moves (if not this move reply that)
